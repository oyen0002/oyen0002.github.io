# Challenges faced while working on my Project


I started working on project three weeks before the due date, I started putting the piece together early on. I add help from David the SPA at my collage, he helps me in some situation that I got stuck and had no idea on what to do next. 

Furthermore, I watch past videos from previous lectures also visited YouTube more inspiration., thinking about this now I should have done that when I was designing my portfolio in User Experience class because I saw some great portfolio ideas I could implement. I was inspired by one of the videos I saw on YouTube which is a refence to my resume page on my project, I will provide the reference link in my reference section.

One of the major challenges I faced was verifying the codes, because I must correct the errors and this may lead to changing the outcome of the initial interface of the site and also twerking the CSS to get the desire outcome. While working on my project i was silently praying that my laptop doesnt disappoint me and it surely did not, thank goodness. 

The most of the images used are from unsplash.com and the wedding pictures were taken by my sister & I , the groom is also my cousin & I seek appropriate consent from the parties involved

<!-- Kindly Note Professor Rob you informed me to do this below -->

As per our last discussion I informed you about the  feedback I got from  Professor Angie's, she was concern about the colours so i had to change it 
and you stated that I should note it down here so you will remember so it doesnt affect my grades. 

Thanky and have a wonderful break. 

Best Regards.
