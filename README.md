# Challenges faced while working on my Project


I started working on project three weeks before the due date, I started putting the piece together early on. I add help from David the SPA at my collage, he helps me in some situation that I got stuck and had no idea on what to do next. 

Furthermore, I watch past videos from previous lectures also visited YouTube more inspiration., thinking about this now I should have done that when I was designing my portfolio in User Experience class because I saw some great portfolio ideas I could implement. I was inspired by one of the videos I saw on YouTube which is a refence to my resume page on my project, I will provide the reference link in my reference section.

One of the major challenges I faced was verifying the codes, because I must correct the errors and this may lead to changing the outcome of the initial interface of the site and also twerking the CSS to get the desire outcome. 
The most of the images used are from unsplash.com and the wedding pictures were taken by my sister & I , the groom is also my cousin & I seek appropriate consent from the parties involved
