            <p> My name is Olugbenga Samuel Oyeniran and my nickname is O.G. I live in Ottawa, but originally from
                Nigeria in West Africa. I currently work with Amazon and my job description ensures I put a smile on
                people’s face by making sure customers gets their orders and gifts in time and a perfect condition. I
                have a first degree in Psychology. I am currently enrolled in the Interactive Media Design program at
                Algonquin college.</p>
            <p> My goal for enrolling in this program is to make a <em>career switch to become a web designer</em>
                because I have been fascinated with web designs, photography & art for a very long time. I am passionate
                about creating solutions and making people feel satisfaction whether it be from online shopping or
                creating a great online shopping experience.</p>
            <p>In addition to this, I have lovely wife who has been the secret to my happiness. Having a reliable spouse
                has made me cherish and value our love. I always look forward to spending a lifetime together.
                as described by<cite> Stephen Kendrick</cite> <q>the only way love can last a lifetime, is
                    if it’s unconditional</q>. I’m indeed grateful for the unconditional love I have received
